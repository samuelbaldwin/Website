            <h2>The Surface Web</h2>
            <p>The Surface Web is the most familiar part of the internet. It consists of content that is indexed by search engines like Google and Bing, making it accessible to anyone with a standard web browser. This layer includes popular websites, blogs, news articles, and forums. It requires no special tools or permissions to access, making it the public face of the internet. Examples of the Surface Web include social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, online shopping sites like Amazon, and informational sites like Wikipedia. However, despite its visibility, the Surface Web only accounts for about 4-5% of the entire internet.</p>

        <div class="information2">
            <h2>The Deepweb</h2>
            <p>Beneath the Surface Web lies the Deep Web, a much larger layer that makes up an estimated 90-95% of the internet. Unlike the Surface Web, the Deep Web contains content that is not indexed by search engines and cannot be accessed through simple searches. This layer includes private and restricted content such as email accounts, online banking portals, subscription-based services like Netflix, and academic or corporate databases. The Deep Web is mostly legal and commonly used for everyday activities, serving as a secure and private space for information that needs to remain out of the public eye.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="information3">
            <h2>The Darkweb</h2>
            <p>The Dark Web exists as a small but significant subset of the Deep Web. This hidden layer requires specialized software, such as the Tor browser, to access. The primary appeal of the Dark Web is its ability to provide anonymity to both users and website operators. Websites on the Dark Web have ".onion" domains and are not accessible via standard web browsers. The Dark Web is known for hosting a mix of content, ranging from anonymous forums and whistleblower platforms to black markets for illicit goods and services. While it offers a safe haven for free speech and privacy advocates, it also attracts individuals engaging in illegal activities. As such, it represents both the potential and the risks of total anonymity online.</p>
