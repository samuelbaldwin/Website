            <h2>The Dark Web Is Tiny Compared to the Deep Web</h2>
            <p>While the Dark Web gets a lot of attention, it is only a small fraction of the Deep Web. The Deep Web includes everything that isn’t indexed by search engines, like private databases, subscription services, and online banking portals. The Dark Web, by comparison, accounts for less than 0.01% of the entire internet.</p>
        </div>    
        <div class="information2">
            <h2>It Was Invented by the U.S. Government</h2>
            <p>The Dark Web wasn't originally designed for illicit activities. It was developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in the mid-1990s to protect government communications. The Tor network, the most popular way to access the Dark Web, still receives funding from the U.S. government for its privacy-preserving potential.</p>
    
        </div>
        <div class="information3">
            <h2>It's a Haven for Free Speech</h2>
            <p>In countries with heavy censorship, the Dark Web provides a safe space for people to express their opinions, organize protests, and access restricted information. This has made it a critical tool for activists and journalists in oppressive regimes.</p>
    
        </div>
        <div class="information4">
            <h2>The Dark Web Has Its Own Search Engines</h2>
            <p>Even though it's not indexed by traditional search engines like Google, the Dark Web has its own search tools, such as Ahmia and DuckDuckGo’s .onion version. However, these search engines often return incomplete results, and finding specific sites can still be a challenge.</p>
    
        </div>
        <div class="information5">
            <h2>Cryptocurrency Thrives on the Dark Web</h2>
            <p>The anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin made them the preferred payment method for transactions on the Dark Web. Today, other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, such as Monero and Zcash, are also gaining popularity in this space.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="information6">
            <h2>Onion Routing Is More Literal Than You Think</h2>
            <p>The Tor network, which is used to access the Dark Web, gets its name from "The Onion Router." The onion metaphor represents the multiple layers of encryption that protect users' anonymity-just like peeling back an onion.</p>
